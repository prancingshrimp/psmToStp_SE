Sheet metal to step file converter for SolidEdge

This converter tool automates the creation of step files out of psm files (Solid Edge sheet metal workbench).
A folder must be specified and the tool will search that folder for psm files. 
A step file is then generated for each file found. This tool requires an installed Solid Edge application.
